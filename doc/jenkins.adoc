=== Plugins

Some plugins are needed for running the pipelines

Pipeline Utility Steps

Used for extracting the pom's project version

=== Global Library

Configure the Global Pipeline Libraries

This is the libraries used for the pipeline. I.e. scripts are located there

image::jenkins/global-pipeline-libraries.png[Library config]
The library name `pipeline-shard` is used in the jenkins file!
So make sure the name is correct.
We stored the lib at: `https://package-repo.mypkfit.com/bitbucket/scm/inf/build-pipeline.git`
We should have some system user for accessing the repository. In the picture, this is my personal login.

=== Configure Git

Git plugin
